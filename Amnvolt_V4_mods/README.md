# 🛠️ Mini ATS V4 – Modifications & Improvements

## 📋 Overview
The **Mini ATS V4** is the latest revision of the well-known all-band receiver based on **ESP32-S3** and **SI4732**.  
While it introduces new features, it also suffers from **strong RF noise**, **VCO leakage**, and **poor ground isolation**.  
This document details the issues, measurements, and hardware fixes that significantly improve its stability and reception quality.

## ⚠️ Original Issues

### 1. VCO Leakage from the SI4732
The SI4732’s internal **VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator)** radiates a strong signal around **3.3–3.46 GHz**, depending on the tuned frequency:

- ~3.3007 GHz at 150 kHz  
- ~3.4610 GHz at 108 MHz  

This leakage couples into the antenna input, creating audible interference and unpredictable RF behavior.

| Model | Description | VCO Signal (dBm) | Screenshot |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Mini ATS V2** | Older revision | −43.8 dBm | ![V2](images/V2.png) |
| **Mini ATS V3S** | With coil mod | −57.7 dBm | ![V3S](images/V3S.png) |
| **Mini ATS V4** | Stock board | **−21.8 dBm ⚠️** | ![V4](images/V4.png) |
| **Mini ATS V4 (after coil mod)** | Improved version | **−49.4 dBm ✅** | ![V4 Coil](images/V4_WITHCOIL.png) |

### 2. “Theremin Effect”
Touching the antenna (especially in **SSB mode**) caused tone shifts and unstable behavior — similar to a *theremin*.  
The SI4732 shielding was highly sensitive to touch and even slight mechanical movement.

### 3. Encoder Clicks & Wi-Fi Spur
Turning or pressing the encoder produced **audible clicks** in the headphones, caused by RF coupling between the **ESP32 Wi-Fi**, **encoder lines**, and **audio amplifier**.

### 4. Headphone Jack as Antenna Input
The Mini ATS V4 attempted to use the headphone cable as an antenna via a **direct trace connection** between the jack and the antenna input — without isolating the ground path.  
This design caused:
- Heavy noise injection  
- Wi-Fi interference  
- Audio path instability

## 🔧 Applied Fixes

### 1️⃣ Isolating Audio from RF
- **Removed the capacitor** linking the headphone output to the antenna input.  
- This isolates the audio ground from the RF path.  
- ✅ *Result:*  
  - No more encoder clicks  
  - Noticeable reduction in Wi-Fi noise  

### 2️⃣ RF Shielding & Mechanical Stabilization
- Added **Kapton tape** over the **VBAT (+)** power switch pins to prevent accidental shorts — they are dangerously close to the SI4732 shield.  
- Placed a small **thermal pad** on top of the SI4732 module to stabilize the shield cover and reduce microphonic coupling.

### 3️⃣ Coil Mod (after Peter Neufeld)
- The **antenna trace** was cut **immediately after the SMA connector**, because the trace continues on the back side to an **ESD protection diode** — leaving no space further down.  
- A **7-turn, 2 mm diameter coil** was inserted in series between the SMA connector and the antenna input.  
- The coil acts as an **RF choke**, drastically reducing VCO coupling and improving RF input stability.

## 🧰 Modification Steps

| Step | Description | Image |
|------|--------------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | Remove the SMA connector (soldered on both sides — handle carefully) | ![Removing SMA](images/1._Removing_the_SMA.jpg) |
| 2️⃣ | Cut the antenna trace just after the SMA (before the ESD diode path) | ![Cut trace](images/2._Cut_the_trace_shorten_the_pin.jpg) |
| 3️⃣ | Re-solder the SMA connector | ![Solder SMA](images/3._Solder_the_SMA.jpg) |
| 3b️⃣ | Remove the coupling capacitor, add Kapton tape and a small thermal pad on the SI4732. The pad acts as a spacer between the chip and the shielding can, reducing the shield’s tendency to behave as an efficient antenna for the SI4732 VCO. | ![Removed cap](images/3b._Capacitor_also_removed.jpg) |
| 4️⃣ | Add the 7-turn (2 mm) coil between SMA and RF input | ![Add coil](images/4._Add_the_coil.jpg) |

## 📈 Results

- The **theremin-effect** was completely eliminated.  
- Only a *very faint noise* remains when touching the **SMA base** (not the antenna).  
- **VCO leakage improved** from −21.8 dBm → −49.4 dBm.  
- **Wi-Fi** and **encoder** interference are practically gone.  
- RF reception is now stable and clean across all bands.

| Theremin Effect | Severe | None |
| RF Stability | Unstable | Stable |

## 🌀 Coil Specification

- **Type:** Air-core RF choke  
- **Turns:** 7 turns  
- **Core diameter:** ≈ 2 mm (wound on a drill bit or similar)  
- **Wire:** Enamelled copper, Ø 0.2 mm  
- **Inductance:** Not critical — the goal is to provide high impedance around 3 GHz, attenuating VCO leakage while maintaining broadband HF/VHF response.  
- **Installation note:** The coil is placed in series between the SMA connector and the antenna trace immediately after the cut point.

## 🧪 Measurement Setup (reproducibility)

- **Instrument:** tinySA Ultra+  
- **Span:** 100 kHz → 6.000 GHz  
- **RBW/VBW:** 850 kHz / 850 kHz  
- **Reference / Attenuation:** 0 dBm / 0 dB  
- **Marker (examples):**  
  - Mini ATS V2 / V3S ≈ **3.527 GHz**  
  - Mini ATS V4 / V4 + coil ≈ **3.087 GHz**  
- **Notes:**  
  - Antenna fully disconnected  
  - **Battery disconnected** during all work and measurements  
  - SI4732 shield in place  
  - SMA base touched only for the *“residual noise at SMA base”* test

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

- Disconnect the **battery** before any soldering or cutting operations.  
- Use ESD precautions.  
- The SMA connector is soldered on **both sides** of the PCB — use controlled heat to avoid pad lifting.  
- All modifications are done **at your own risk** and will **void any warranty**.
