## ⭐ Highlights
- **June 2025 / upgraded version.**
- **Built‑in Hi‑Z circuit** to improve weak‑signal handling on long‑wire/Hi‑Z antennas (The same with V3, a very simple High-Z circuit with a JFET).
- **Built‑in headphone amplifier** — noticeably louder in headphones than previous non‑amp versions (V1 actually, V2 and later has headphone amp).
- **Injection‑molded ABS enclosure** (stronger and cleaner than prior 3D‑printed shells). That's a really good upgrade.
- **JFET power circuit optimized** — no more “battery drain after shutdown” issue.
- **1.9‑inch IPS color display** (170×320) with adjustable backlight and on‑screen battery level.
- **800 mAh Li‑Po battery**; manufacturer quotes **10+ hours** typical listening.
- **Firmware upgradable** (ESP32 platform).

## ⚠️ Notes & Tips
- Use a **standard 5 V USB‑C charger** (no QC/PD fast‑charge).  
- As with any **Li‑Po** battery, avoid over‑discharge and store at moderate charge if unused for long periods. LiPo batteries (single cell) must be between 3.7V to 3.85V for storage.

## 📐 Measurements

* **V3S power supply noise measurements** → [Power Supply Noise](./Power_Supply_Noise/README.md)  
  Includes oscilloscope tests on the JFET Source (pin 2), SI4732 VDD_RF (pin10), and power switch output.  
  Covers both **DC bias voltages** and **AC ripple/noise analysis**, identifying the cleanest supply rail for the Hi-Z input stage.

## 📐 JFET Noise Reduction Mod

* **V3S power supply noise reduction modification** → [JFET_Power_Supply_Mod](./JFET_Power_Supply_Mod/README.md)  
  Based on Peter Neufeld’s modification → [Si4732A MiniRX Modifications](https://peterneufeld.wordpress.com/2025/06/13/si4732a-minirx-modifications/)  
  The JFET (K51G) is now powered from SI4732 Pin 10.  
  Includes DC voltage drop measurements, Oscilloscope comparition etc from the PCB supply and from the SI4732 pin 10 etc.

## 🔬Receiving Tests/Differences Between MiniATS V3S, MiniATS V2 and RTL-SDR V3

- I test the same day, with the same antenna (Moonraker X1-HF), same coax (RG58) and a FM notch filter the three versions of MiniATS receivers.
  Results are [**here**](..//V2_vs_V3S_vs_RTL-SDR_V3/).
